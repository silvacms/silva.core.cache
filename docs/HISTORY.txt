Changes
=======

2.3.3 (unreleased)
------------------

* Refactored cache key generator for method and property decorator.
  cached_property and cached_method now both take a 'key' argument (the
  key generator).  The default key generator for each is now a top-level 
  function in the descriptors module.  The code to serialize the method
  args into a 1-tuple was factored out of the keygen code (so other key
  generators can use it).
   
* Added support for preventing caching of a decorated method or property.
  If this support is desired, the key generator should raise the
  descriptors.DontCache exception.  (useful for key generators

* Fixed ascii decoding bug with a simple str of _p_oid.  Instead base64
  encode _p_oid first.

2.3.2 (2010/10/27)
------------------

* Ensure caching keys are always string. This is required by memcache
  implementations.

2.3.1 (2010/10/18)
------------------

* Fix cookie path for cookie session in case of virtual host hosting.

2.3 (2010/10/06)
----------------

* Initial release.
